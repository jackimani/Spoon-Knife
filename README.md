## Training on Github in August
To use headings use the \# symbol \is used to not run the command

## Styling text
**Use two asterics for bold**

*use one asteric for italics*

~~use two tilde for striking through~~

**use double star and _underscore_ for italics**

This is for subscript <sub>**Use sub html style**</sub>

This is superscript <sup> **bold embeded**</sup>

## Quoting Text
> when quiting text, highlight text then either use **R**, or use the forward sign

## Quoting code

use single backtick \` and not the apostrophe, to call out code or commands, such as to `git status`. To format code into its own command, use tripple ticks as shown below. recommend to put once space before and after the line code. More on [Highlighting code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)
```
git status
git add
git clone 

```
## Color models
Within the pull request, use a single backtick \` within the color codes to view the text in the desired color, such as
`rgb(9,105,118)` to view the color scheme. ### **I have not grasped this but i will come back to it.**

## Links in markdown
u can wrap name of the link in bracket `[]`, then wrap the url in brackets `()`. an example of using the links
is shown where we experiment with it on [Github](https://pages.github.com/).

## Section links
**NOTE** I have not learnt anything about this section, I will *revisit*

## Relative links
A relative link is a link that references the current working directory. If is a link, we use the same way as link in markdown where we have a a`[]` and link in brackets `()`, style for easy remembering.
